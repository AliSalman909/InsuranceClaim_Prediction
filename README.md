# InsuranceClaim_Prediction

This project uses Linear Regression to estimate medical insurance charges based on personal attributes like age, BMI, and smoking status. The goal is to understand how these features affect insurance claim amounts and evaluate model performance using MAE and RMSE.

##  Files Included
- `insurance_prediction.py`: Python script that loads data, visualizes it, trains a model, and evaluates predictions.
- `insurance.csv`: Dataset (stored locally in the `/task4/` directory).  
  ➤ ⚠Make sure to update the file path** in the script based on your machine:

## Objective
Predict the charges column (insurance cost) based on:
Age
BMI
Number of Children
Smoking status
Gender
Region

## Skills Demonstrated
Data visualization with Seaborn & Matplotlib
One-hot encoding of categorical features
Linear regression modeling
Model evaluation using:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
